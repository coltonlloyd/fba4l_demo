# Interactive demo of FBA for Lehninger

The goal of FBA for Lehninger is to bring metabolic networks to life
via flux balance analysis (FBA), a powerful computational modeling technique. 
We believe applying this approach to the metabolic pathways described in Lehninger's
*Principles of Biochemistry* will prove a rich accompaniment to traditional
biochemistry education.

To demonstrate the resource's potential, we selected three excerpts 
to share via an interactive Jupyter Book. This includes:

1. **Chapter 5**: Introduces alternative pathways using the Pentose Phosphate Pathway.
2. **Chapter 11**: Uses metabolic modeling to explore the impact of a rare inborn error of metabolism.
3. **Chapter Problems**: Presents Lehninger chapter problems alongside demonstrations 
   of how computational modeling can solve them.

The python code that generates the figures is included. By clicking
the Live Code Launch Button (the rocket icon in the top right corner), the python code 
can be modified and executed within the internet browser â€” no local Python installation needed. 

Activating Live Code and running the code also enables interactive 
widgets that let you adjust the growth conditions of the metabolic network. The resulting 
changes in metabolic fluxes are visualized on the network using Escher
